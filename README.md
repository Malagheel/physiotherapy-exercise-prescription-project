# Business Analysis Project: Physiotherapy Patient Portal Enhancement

This repository is a comprehensive portfolio project demonstrating the analysis, documentation, and testing lifecycle for a new software feature. The project showcases skills in business analysis, systems analysis, and quality assurance as applied to a real-world, health-tech scenario.

## Project Summary

The project's goal is to enhance a physiotherapy clinic's Patient Portal by adding an **"Online Exercise Prescription"** feature. This addresses the inefficiencies of using paper handouts by allowing physiotherapists to assign and manage digital exercise programs. This project documents the entire process, from the initial business case to the final testing and issue management phase, ensuring the proposed feature meets both business goals and user needs.

## Project Documents

Each of the following documents represents a key stage in the analysis and planning process.

* **[Change_Request.md](Change_Request.md):** The initial form proposing the enhancement, outlining the business justification and its value to the clinic.
* **[Functional_Specifications.md](Functional_Specifications.md):** The detailed requirements, including user stories and Gherkin-style acceptance criteria that would guide the development team.
* **[Data_Flow_Diagram.png](Data_Flow_Diagram.png):** A visual representation of how data moves between the users and the system for this new feature.
* **[Test_Plan_UAT_QA.md](Test_Plan_UAT_QA.md):** A comprehensive plan for both User Acceptance Testing (UAT) and internal Quality Assurance (QA), including detailed test cases.
* **[Sample_Bug_Reports.md](Sample_Bug_Reports.md):** Examples of professional bug reports, formatted as JIRA-style tickets, to manage issues found during testing.
