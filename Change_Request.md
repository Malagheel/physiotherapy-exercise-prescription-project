### 1. Description of Change

This change request proposes the development and implementation of a new "Online Exercise Prescription" feature within the existing Patient Portal.

This will allow accredited physiotherapists to create, assign, and manage custom exercise programs for their patients directly through the portal. Patients will be able to log in and view their prescribed exercises, including detailed instructions, images, and video demonstrations.

### 2. Business Justification & Goals

The current method of providing patients with photocopied paper handouts of exercises is outdated, costly, and ineffective for tracking patient progress. Implementing a digital solution will:

* **Improve Patient Adherence:** Provide patients with clear, accessible, and engaging exercise programs, which is proven to increase compliance and improve clinical outcomes.
* **Enhance Patient Experience:** Modernize the clinic's service delivery and provide patients with a professional, interactive tool to manage their recovery.
* **Increase Clinic Efficiency:** Reduce time and costs associated with printing and managing paper handouts. Allow physiotherapists to create and reuse exercise templates for common conditions.
* **Enable Progress Tracking:** Create a foundation for future features, such as allowing patients to log their activity and report their pain levels.

### 3. High-Level Requirements

* Physiotherapists must be able to search a pre-loaded library of common physiotherapy exercises.
* Physiotherapists must be able to add exercises to a patient's profile and specify parameters (e.g., sets, repetitions, frequency).
* Patients must be able to log in to the portal and view their assigned exercise program on a clean, mobile-friendly interface.
* Each exercise must have a description, a still image, and a link to a demonstration video.

### 4. Expected Impact

* **Systems:** The Patient Portal will require a new section for "My Exercises." The database will need new tables to store the exercise library and link assigned programs to patient profiles.
* **Operations:** Physiotherapists will require a brief training session on how to use the new feature. Front-desk staff may need to answer patient questions about logging in.
